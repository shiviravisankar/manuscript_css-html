          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>The book provides 3 main takeaways,
          <ul>
          <li>Learn to recognize exclusion and when it occurs</li>
          <li>Learn & take the right inferences from diversity</li>
          <li>Solve for one, extend it across many</li>
          </ul>
          
              The idea of universal design is powerful. Designers often rely on generalizations across many dimensions of design-thinking, ultimately resulting in sterilized solutions befitting of both everyone and no one. Mismatch is a short look at ways that people feel excluded through design. Holmes opens the book focusing on in-group/out-group mentalities, arguing that inclusivity is possible through inclusive design processes. She follows a <q>Who, What, Why, When, How</q> model that serves her argument well. 
          
              Sometimes designed objects reject their users, products and infrastructures designed by designers leave out entire populations who cannot use them. A computer mouse that doesn't work for left-handed people, or a touchscreen payment system that only works for people who read English phrases, have 20/20 vision, and use a credit card. People in wheelchairs for whom access to certain buildings is impossible. Similarly, racialized people are confronted with facial recognition systems that are set up to distinguish only white-skinned people.The small size of some women forces them to wear shoes in the children's department. Each of these examples is a "mismatch", a design anomaly that deprives a group of people of the use of a product. From these mismatches comes a strong feeling of exclusion. How can we proceed to design and innovate in an inclusive way?

          <p>Something as simple as color choices can render a product unusable for millions. These mismatches are the building blocks of exclusion. In Mismatch, Kat Holmes describes how design can lead to exclusion, and how design can also remedy exclusion. Inclusive design methods: designing objects with rather than for excluded users can create elegant solutions that work well and benefit all.</p>

          <b>Three Fears of Inclusion</b><br>
          <i>Inclusion isn't nice</i><br>
          <body>A fear of using the wrong words, and offending people, must be worked through. Many organizations can use the right words but really not mean it or care to implement any change. Develop a shared language to support inclusion.</body> <br>
          <i>Inclusion is imperfect</i> <br>
          <body>You can't design a solution for absolutely everyone. But that shouldn't stop you from trying.</body><br>
          <i>Inclusion is ongoing</i><br>
          <body>No solution is perfect. Every solution needs care and maintenance over time, and the field of inclusion itself is developing and in search of a better vocabulary.</body><br>
          <blockquote><b>Each time we remedy a mismatched interaction, we open an opportunity for more people to contribute to society in meaningful ways. This, in turn, changes who can participate in building our world.

          <p>You can't say <q>you can't play</q>. Those in power, and those who like control, object to this rule, but it has incredibly positive impacts on those that are repeatedly excluded. And the negatives realized by the objectors can often be counteracted by the contributions added by those newly included.

              <q>We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us</q>. The solutions we produce change society and all future solutions must reflect the previous solutions that have shaped society.</p>

          <summary><b>Chapter 3: The Cycle of Exclusion</b></summary>
          <p>People who have experienced forms of exclusion will be able to contribute these experiences to the design process. Teams without people who have been excluded in certain ways are likely to exclude future users in those same ways.<br><br>
            <b>Two Side Effects of Exclusion</b><br>
            <i>Social invisibility</i><br>
            Because of the in-out dichotomy, people who are consistently <q>out</q> can be forgotten in society. When entire categories of people have their needs ignored consistently, other people forget about them again in the future, and this cycle reinforces stereotypes and further isolates these people from society.<br>
            
            <i>Pain of rejection</i><br>
            Studies show that social rejection approximates the same effect as physical pain in the body. Rejection can also manifest emotionally, through sadness or anger.<br><br>
            <blockquote><q>Every human interaction that includes technology gains a wild card: who will it reject and who will it accept?</q>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote><q>Every day, design teams make incorrect assumptions about people.</q></blockquote>
            Every designer must be conscious of why they design solutions &#8211; it starts with leadership making inclusion part of an organization&#x27;s culture.

          <p>The game design industry has historically been dominated by people assuming that every user will be exactly like they are in that present moment. I wonder if this even applies to designers imagining players will play the game exactly like they would.<br>
          Open-source tools allow more people to contribute to a variety of areas in which they have been implemented.<br><br>
          <b>Three skills of successful inclusive designers</b><br>
          <i>Identify ability biases and mismatched interactions between people and the world</i><br>
          Ensure that teams have designers with a diverse range of experiences. Ensure that the culture of a team or organization supports inclusive design. Avoid ability bias, using your own ability level as a baseline for designing something. Disability = mismatched human interactions, not a personal health condition.<br>

          <i>Create a diversity of ways to participate in an experience</i><br>
          Design multiple options for doing the same thing, or for doing similar things, so that there are many ways to experience the design. Challenges include lack of design education dedicated to inclusion, a complex legally-derived lexicon, and a lack of modernization in the technologies that can enable accessible practice in the design process, e.g. conducting usability testing in person with paper while technology speeds ahead.<br>

          <i>Design for interdependence and bring complementary skills together</i><br>
          America has the damaging ideal of a lone wolf, someone who makes it on their own, due to their own abilities. Teams should be interdependent rather than independent, and it&#x27;s perfectly okay for people to depend on assistive artifacts. Design ways for people to collaborate with each other.<br>
          Accessibility is an attribute of a design &#8211; inclusive design is a method.<br>
          <blockquote><q>Most accessibility criteria grew out of policies and laws that were designed to ensure barrier-free access for specific disability communities.</q></blockquote>&#8211;Wheelchair access is recent, the result of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, of 1990.
          <blockquote><q>Inclusive design should always start with a solid understanding of accessibility fundamentals.</q></blockquote>
          Universal design = framework aimed at designing a single, fixed product that has the widest range of use cases possible. Particularly applies to physical attributes, in fields like architecture and environmental design.

          <p>Through the experience of Tiffany Brown, a black woman architect working on social housing in Detroit and co-founder of 400 forward , all the racial, gender and economical biases of politics in the city are exposed. Her experience shows how she intervenes for a careful impact through participatory practices against political decisions and built environments previously taken ignoring the population's needs if not explicitly against them. While this extreme case, poses all the problems and essential differences between "designing with" and "designing for", central to this chapter, a second example might have further explored the positive contribution of community and people diversity to the design process and outcome against prejudicial and patronizing decisions of designers and administrators in positions of leadership.<br>
          <blockquote><q><b>These types of considerations are something I have to think hard about to understand how I can best serve inclusion as a designer. I am white, male, had an uneventful upper-middle class upbringing, and have not been excluded by virtually any design I&#x27;ve ever encountered. With this in mind, how can I best contribute to inclusion on a design team? I know I must get others involved, people who have had different experiences than me and can see things in a way that I never can. As of right now, I&#x27;m not sure how to implement these ideas, but I know this is something I have to carry with me as I move forward.</b></q></blockquote>

          <summary><b>Chapter 6 : Matchmaking</b></summary>
          <p>
            Many design attempts, though ostensibly well-intentioned, can fail through subconscious adoption of an <q>us vs. them</q> mentality.<br>

            One group of designers is designing for another group of people, but none of the designers is in that group. They tend to rely on stereotypes of that group to design their product, and this is problematic.<br>

            Building a community of <q>exclusion experts</q> &#8211; people who you expect to be most disadvantaged by your product. Asking for their expertise and opinions on features and changes is the best way to ensure that your design is inclusive to the groups these experts belong to.<br>

            It is vital to understand how potential changes to your product will affect different users in different ways, particularly on an emotional level, but also on a functional one.<br>

          <summary><b>Chapter 7 : There&#x27;s no such thing as Normal</b></summary>
            <p>The common habit of adopting averages instead of spectra is criticized as leading toward a design-for-all and none approach. Since nobody is average but everybody is unique, designing for averages means to design for nobody real; inclusion in this perspective means collecting thicker data and building deeper models and methods. <br>

            The <q>persona spectrum</q> method presented aims at working on a scale of personas, which include various degrees of exclusion for specific abilities in the range of permanent, temporary or situational mismatches. <br>
            
            The shift in approach suggested, named exclusively in the title of the paragraph, is from human-centered toward a human-led design. Where by centering, we focus on one average, universal individual, in opposition with the observations of variable spectra of people.<br>

            To demonstrate this effect and to close the five steps cycle framework, the author introduces a series of short examples on artifacts made with one exclusion expert in mind from typewriters to the highly debated straws.

          These examples lead to four new recommendations addressed specifically to the business world, which are:<br><br>
            <i>Customer Engagement</i><br>
            Half is about presenting the existing hacks that disadvantaged users have created for your product and explaining how a new design can improve their experience. Half is about engaging customers in the design process itself, which can have a profound impact on their product loyalty.<br><br>

            <i>Customer Base Growth</i><br>
            Including communities that were previously excluded &#8211; can be presented convincingly through persona spectra<br><br>

            <i>Innovation driven by Inclusion</i><br>
            Many companies have scores of ideas that they generated but never implemented in the market &#8211; introducing inclusion-driven problems can often lead to ways to utilize this untapped potential. Also, expanding design teams to include members with different ability biases helps ideation overall by creating a more diverse background across all metrics, not just ability.<br><br>

            <i>Warning against Retrofitting</i><br>
            Products that go to market without being accessible can incur costs in terms of customer support, lost customers, or even lawsuits. Considering inclusion from the start can minimize these costs by addressing them proactively rather than reactively.<br>

          <summary><b>Chapter 9: Inclusion is designing the future</b></summary>
          <p>
            In conclusion, Holmes gives a look to our future, in a partly literal and partly metaphorical way. A very literal approach is to take into account our personal individual future as aging humans with ever-changing abilities. In a world with a growing number of aging people, the problem scales up quickly. Therefore, the question arises about whether we are capable of adopting inclusive methods to teach the next generation of designers and leaders. Our collective future will be shaped by economic and social inequity and further affected by machines. However, when machines with the ability to learn acquire also our biases, what exclusion will they produce? This makes it a problem today.

            In conclusion, Holmes gives a look to our future, in a partly literal and partly metaphorical way. A very literal approach is to take into account our personal individual future as aging humans with ever-changing abilities. In a world with a growing number of aging people, the problem scales up quickly. Therefore, the question arises about whether we are capable of adopting inclusive methods to teach the next generation of designers and leaders. Our collective future will be shaped by economic and social inequity and further affected by machines. However, when machines with the ability to learn acquire also our biases, what exclusion will they produce? This makes it a problem today.

          <body>A fear of using the wrong words, and offending people, must be worked through. Many organizations can use the right words but really not mean it or care to implement any change. Develop a shared language to support inclusion.</body> <br>
          <i>Inclusion is imperfect</i> <br>
          <body>You can't design a solution for absolutely everyone. But that shouldn't stop you from trying.</body><br>
          <i>Inclusion is ongoing</i><br>

            <b>Two Side Effects of Exclusion</b><br>
            <i>Social invisibility</i><br>
            Because of the in-out dichotomy, people who are consistently <q>out</q> can be forgotten in society. When entire categories of people have their needs ignored consistently, other people forget about them again in the future, and this cycle reinforces stereotypes and further isolates these people from society.<br>
            
            <i>Pain of rejection</i><br>
            Studies show that social rejection approximates the same effect as physical pain in the body. Rejection can also manifest emotionally, through sadness or anger.<br><br>
            <blockquote><q>Every human interaction that includes technology gains a wild card: who will it reject and who will it accept?</q>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote><q>Every day, design teams make incorrect assumptions about people.</q></blockquote>
            Every designer must be conscious of why they design solutions &#8211; it starts with leadership making inclusion part of an organization&#x27;s culture.

          <p>The game design industry has historically been dominated by people assuming that every user will be exactly like they are in that present moment. I wonder if this even applies to designers imagining players will play the game exactly like they would.<br>
          Open-source tools allow more people to contribute to a variety of areas in which they have been implemented.<br><br>
          <b>Three skills of successful inclusive designers</b><br>
          <i>Identify ability biases and mismatched interactions between people and the world</i><br>
          Ensure that teams have designers with a diverse range of experiences. Ensure that the culture of a team or organization supports inclusive design. Avoid ability bias, using your own ability level as a baseline for designing something. Disability = mismatched human interactions, not a personal health condition.<br>

          <i>Create a diversity of ways to participate in an experience</i><br>
          Design multiple options for doing the same thing, or for doing similar things, so that there are many ways to experience the design. Challenges include lack of design education dedicated to inclusion, a complex legally-derived lexicon, and a lack of modernization in the technologies that can enable accessible practice in the design process, e.g. conducting usability testing in person with paper while technology speeds ahead.<br>

          <i>Design for interdependence and bring complementary skills together</i><br>
          America has the damaging ideal of a lone wolf, someone who makes it on their own, due to their own abilities. Teams should be interdependent rather than independent, and it&#x27;s perfectly okay for people to depend on assistive artifacts. Design ways for people to collaborate with each other.<br>
          Accessibility is an attribute of a design &#8211; inclusive design is a method.<br>
          <blockquote><q>Most accessibility criteria grew out of policies and laws that were designed to ensure barrier-free access for specific disability communities.</q></blockquote>&#8211;Wheelchair access is recent, the result of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, of 1990.
          <blockquote><q>Inclusive design should always start with a solid understanding of accessibility fundamentals.</q></blockquote>
          Universal design = framework aimed at designing a single, fixed product that has the widest range of use cases possible. Particularly applies to physical attributes, in fields like architecture and environmental design.

While this extreme case, poses all the problems and essential differences between "designing with" and "designing for", central to this chapter, a second example might have further explored the positive contribution of community and people diversity to the design process and outcome against prejudicial and patronizing decisions of designers and administrators in positions of leadership.<br>

            Many design attempts, though ostensibly well-intentioned, can fail through subconscious adoption of an <q>us vs. them</q> mentality.<br>

            One group of designers is designing for another group of people, but none of the designers is in that group. They tend to rely on stereotypes of that group to design their product, and this is problematic.<br>

            Building a community of <q>exclusion experts</q> &#8211; people who you expect to be most disadvantaged by your product. Asking for their expertise and opinions on features and changes is the best way to ensure that your design is inclusive to the groups these experts belong to.<br>

            <i>Customer Base Growth</i><br>
            Including communities that were previously excluded &#8211; can be presented convincingly through persona spectra<br><br>

            Many companies have scores of ideas that they generated but never implemented in the market &#8211; introducing inclusion-driven problems can often lead to ways to utilize this untapped potential.

          <p>
            In conclusion, Holmes gives a look to our future, in a partly literal and partly metaphorical way. A very literal approach is to take into account our personal individual future as aging humans with ever-changing abilities. In a world with a growing number of aging people, the problem scales up quickly. Therefore, the question arises about whether we are capable of adopting inclusive methods to teach the next generation of designers and leaders. Our collective future will be shaped by economic and social inequity and further affected by machines. However, when machines with the ability to learn acquire also our biases, what exclusion will they produce? This makes it a problem today.

          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>The book provides 3 main takeaways,
          <ul>
          <li>Learn to recognize exclusion and when it occurs</li>
          <li>Learn & take the right inferences from diversity</li>
          <li>Solve for one, extend it across many</li>
          </ul>
          
              The idea of universal design is powerful. Designers often rely on generalizations across many dimensions of design-thinking, ultimately resulting in sterilized solutions befitting of both everyone and no one. Mismatch is a short look at ways that people feel excluded through design. Holmes opens the book focusing on in-group/out-group mentalities, arguing that inclusivity is possible through inclusive design processes. She follows a <q>Who, What, Why, When, How</q> model that serves her argument well. 
          
              Sometimes designed objects reject their users, products and infrastructures designed by designers leave out entire populations who cannot use them. A computer mouse that doesn't work for left-handed people, or a touchscreen payment system that only works for people who read English phrases, have 20/20 vision, and use a credit card. People in wheelchairs for whom access to certain buildings is impossible. Similarly, racialized people are confronted with facial recognition systems that are set up to distinguish only white-skinned people.The small size of some women forces them to wear shoes in the children's department. Each of these examples is a "mismatch", a design anomaly that deprives a group of people of the use of a product. From these mismatches comes a strong feeling of exclusion. How can we proceed to design and innovate in an inclusive way?

          <summary><b>Chapter 1: Welcome</b></summary>
          <p>Something as simple as color choices can render a product unusable for millions. These mismatches are the building blocks of exclusion. In Mismatch, Kat Holmes describes how design can lead to exclusion, and how design can also remedy exclusion. Inclusive design methods: designing objects with rather than for excluded users can create elegant solutions that work well and benefit all.</p>
          <blockquote><q>An inclusive environment is far more than the shape of its doors, chairs, and rampways. It also considers the psychological and emotional impact on people.</q></blockquote>
          <blockquote><q>Accessibility, sociology, and civil rights weren't required curricula for learning how to build technology.</q></blockquote>
          <b>Three Fears of Inclusion</b><br>
          <i>Inclusion isn't nice</i><br>
          <body>A fear of using the wrong words, and offending people, must be worked through. Many organizations can use the right words but really not mean it or care to implement any change. Develop a shared language to support inclusion.</body> <br>
          <i>Inclusion is imperfect</i> <br>
          <body>You can't design a solution for absolutely everyone. But that shouldn't stop you from trying.</body><br>
          <i>Inclusion is ongoing</i><br>
          <body>No solution is perfect. Every solution needs care and maintenance over time, and the field of inclusion itself is developing and in search of a better vocabulary.</body><br>
          <blockquote><b>Each time we remedy a mismatched interaction, we open an opportunity for more people to contribute to society in meaningful ways. This, in turn, changes who can participate in building our world.

          <p>You can't say <q>you can't play</q>. Those in power, and those who like control, object to this rule, but it has incredibly positive impacts on those that are repeatedly excluded. And the negatives realized by the objectors can often be counteracted by the contributions added by those newly included.

              <q>We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us</q>. The solutions we produce change society and all future solutions must reflect the previous solutions that have shaped society.</p>

        <details>
          <summary><b>Chapter 3: The Cycle of Exclusion</b></summary>
          <p>People who have experienced forms of exclusion will be able to contribute these experiences to the design process. Teams without people who have been excluded in certain ways are likely to exclude future users in those same ways.<br><br>
            <b>Two Side Effects of Exclusion</b><br>
            <i>Social invisibility</i><br>
            Because of the in-out dichotomy, people who are consistently <q>out</q> can be forgotten in society. When entire categories of people have their needs ignored consistently, other people forget about them again in the future, and this cycle reinforces stereotypes and further isolates these people from society.<br>
            
            <i>Pain of rejection</i><br>
            Studies show that social rejection approximates the same effect as physical pain in the body. Rejection can also manifest emotionally, through sadness or anger.<br><br>
            <blockquote><q>Every human interaction that includes technology gains a wild card: who will it reject and who will it accept?</q>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote><q>Every day, design teams make incorrect assumptions about people.</q></blockquote>
            Every designer must be conscious of why they design solutions &#8211; it starts with leadership making inclusion part of an organization&#x27;s culture.

          <summary><b>Chapter 4: Inclusive Designers</b></summary>
          <p>The game design industry has historically been dominated by people assuming that every user will be exactly like they are in that present moment. I wonder if this even applies to designers imagining players will play the game exactly like they would.<br>
          Open-source tools allow more people to contribute to a variety of areas in which they have been implemented.<br><br>
          <b>Three skills of successful inclusive designers</b><br>
          <i>Identify ability biases and mismatched interactions between people and the world</i><br>
          Ensure that teams have designers with a diverse range of experiences. Ensure that the culture of a team or organization supports inclusive design. Avoid ability bias, using your own ability level as a baseline for designing something. Disability = mismatched human interactions, not a personal health condition.<br>

          <i>Create a diversity of ways to participate in an experience</i><br>
          Design multiple options for doing the same thing, or for doing similar things, so that there are many ways to experience the design. Challenges include lack of design education dedicated to inclusion, a complex legally-derived lexicon, and a lack of modernization in the technologies that can enable accessible practice in the design process, e.g. conducting usability testing in person with paper while technology speeds ahead.<br>

          <i>Design for interdependence and bring complementary skills together</i><br>
          America has the damaging ideal of a lone wolf, someone who makes it on their own, due to their own abilities. Teams should be interdependent rather than independent, and it&#x27;s perfectly okay for people to depend on assistive artifacts. Design ways for people to collaborate with each other.<br>
          Accessibility is an attribute of a design &#8211; inclusive design is a method.<br>
          <blockquote><q>Most accessibility criteria grew out of policies and laws that were designed to ensure barrier-free access for specific disability communities.</q></blockquote>&#8211;Wheelchair access is recent, the result of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, of 1990.
          <blockquote><q>Inclusive design should always start with a solid understanding of accessibility fundamentals.</q></blockquote>
          Universal design = framework aimed at designing a single, fixed product that has the widest range of use cases possible. Particularly applies to physical attributes, in fields like architecture and environmental design.

          <p>Through the experience of Tiffany Brown, a black woman architect working on social housing in Detroit and co-founder of 400 forward , all the racial, gender and economical biases of politics in the city are exposed. Her experience shows how she intervenes for a careful impact through participatory practices against political decisions and built environments previously taken ignoring the population's needs if not explicitly against them. While this extreme case, poses all the problems and essential differences between "designing with" and "designing for", central to this chapter, a second example might have further explored the positive contribution of community and people diversity to the design process and outcome against prejudicial and patronizing decisions of designers and administrators in positions of leadership.<br>
          <blockquote><q><b>These types of considerations are something I have to think hard about to understand how I can best serve inclusion as a designer. I am white, male, had an uneventful upper-middle class upbringing, and have not been excluded by virtually any design I&#x27;ve ever encountered. With this in mind, how can I best contribute to inclusion on a design team? I know I must get others involved, people who have had different experiences than me and can see things in a way that I never can. As of right now, I&#x27;m not sure how to implement these ideas, but I know this is something I have to carry with me as I move forward.</b></q></blockquote>

          <summary><b>Chapter 6 : Matchmaking</b></summary>
          <p>
            Many design attempts, though ostensibly well-intentioned, can fail through subconscious adoption of an <q>us vs. them</q> mentality.<br>

            One group of designers is designing for another group of people, but none of the designers is in that group. They tend to rely on stereotypes of that group to design their product, and this is problematic.<br>

            Building a community of <q>exclusion experts</q> &#8211; people who you expect to be most disadvantaged by your product. Asking for their expertise and opinions on features and changes is the best way to ensure that your design is inclusive to the groups these experts belong to.<br>

            It is vital to understand how potential changes to your product will affect different users in different ways, particularly on an emotional level, but also on a functional one.<br>

          <summary><b>Chapter 7 : There&#x27;s no such thing as Normal</b></summary>
            <p>The common habit of adopting averages instead of spectra is criticized as leading toward a design-for-all and none approach. Since nobody is average but everybody is unique, designing for averages means to design for nobody real; inclusion in this perspective means collecting thicker data and building deeper models and methods. <br>

            The <q>persona spectrum</q> method presented aims at working on a scale of personas, which include various degrees of exclusion for specific abilities in the range of permanent, temporary or situational mismatches. <br>
            
            The shift in approach suggested, named exclusively in the title of the paragraph, is from human-centered toward a human-led design. Where by centering, we focus on one average, universal individual, in opposition with the observations of variable spectra of people.<br>
